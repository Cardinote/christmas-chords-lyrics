{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dashing through the snow
In a [G]one-horse open [C]sleigh.
[Am]O'er the fields we [D7]go
[D7]Laughing all the [G]way.
[G]Bells on bobtail ring
[G]Making spirits [C]bright.
What [Am]fun it is to [D]ride and sing
[D7]A sleighing song [G]tonight!
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
[G]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[C]Oh what fun it [G]is to ride
In a [A7]one-horse open [D7]sleigh, hey!
[G]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[C]Oh what fun it [G]is to ride
In a [D7]one-horse open [G]sleigh.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [G]day or two ago,
I [G]thought I'd take a [C]ride,
And [Am]soon Miss Fanny [D7]Bright
Was [D7]seated by my [G]side.
The [G]horse was lean and lank;
Mis[G]fortune seemed his [C]lot.
He [Am]got into a [D]drifted bank
And [D7]then we got up[G]sot.
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Now the ground is white,
[G]Go it while you're [C]young.
[Am]Take the girls to[D7]night
and [D7]sing this sleighing [G]song.
[G]Get a bobtailed bay,
Two [G]forty as his [C]speed.
[Am]Hitch him to an [D]open sleigh
And [D7]crack! you'll take the [G]lead, oh!
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Chorus}
