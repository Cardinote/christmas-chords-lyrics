God [Em]rest you merry, gentle[C]men,
Let [C]nothing [Am7]you dis[B7]may,
For [Em]Jesus Christ our Sa[C]viour
Was [C]born [Am7]upon this [B7]day,
To [C]save us [G]all from [D]Satan's[Em] power
When [Em]we were gone as[D]tray;
{end_of_verse}

O [G]ti[C]dings of [B7]comfort and [Em]joy,
[Em]Comfort and [D]joy,
O [G]ti[D]dings of [B7]comfort and [Em]joy.

From [Em]God our heavenly Fa[C]ther
A [C]blessed [Am7]angel [B7]came,
And [Em]unto certain shep[C]herds,
Brought [C]tidings [Am7]of the [B7]same;
How [C]that in [G]Bethle[D]hem was [Em]born
The [Em]Son of God by [D]name,
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [Em]shepherds at those [C]tidings
Re[C]joiced [Am7]much in [B7]mind,
And [Em]left their flocks a-[C]feeding
In [C]tempest, [Am7]storm and [B7]wind,
And [C]went to [G]Bethle[D]hem straight[Em]way,
This [Em]blessed Babe to [D]find.

But [Em]when to Bethlehem they [C]came,
Where[C]at this [Am7]Infant [B7]lay,
They [Em]found Him in a man[C]ger,
Where [C]oxen [Am7]feed on [B7]hay;
His [C]mother [G]Mary [D]knee[Em]ling,
Un[Em]to the Lord did [D]pray.
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Refrain}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now [Em]to the Lord sing prai[C]ses,
All [C]you with[Am7]in this [B7]place,
And [Em]with true love and brother[C]hood
Each [C]other [Am7]now em[B7]brace;
This [C]holy [G]tide of [D]Christ[Em]mas
All [Em]other doth de[D]face.
{end_of_verse}
