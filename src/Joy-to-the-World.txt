{start_of_verse}
[G]Joy to the world; the Lord [D7]is [G]come!
Let [C]earth re[D7]ceive her [G]King!
Let [G]every heart prepare Him room,
And [G]Heaven and nature sing,
And [D7]Heaven and nature sing,
And [G]Heaven, and Heaven, and na[D7]ture [G]sing.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]Joy to the earth, the Sa[D7]vior [G]reigns!
Let [C]men their [D7]songs em[G]ploy;
While [G]fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
Re[G]peat the sounding joy,
Re[D7]peat the sounding joy,
Re[G]peat, repeat, the soun[D7]ding [G]joy.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]No more let sins and sor[D7]rows [G]grow,
Nor [C]thorns in[D7]fest the [G]ground;
He [G]comes to make His blessings flow
Far [G]as the curse is found,
Far [D7]as the curse is found,
Far [G]as, far as, the curse [D7]is [G]found.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
[G]He rules the world with truth [D7]and [G]grace,
And [C]makes the [D7]nations [G]prove
The [G]glories of His righteousness,
And [G]wonders of His love,
And [D7]wonders of His love,
And [G]wonders, And wonders, of [D7]His [G]love.
