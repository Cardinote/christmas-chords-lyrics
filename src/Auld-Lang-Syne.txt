{start_of_verse}
Should [G]old acquaintance [D]be forgot,
and [Em]never [G]brought to [C]mind?
Should [G]old acquaintance [D]be forgot,
and [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
For [G]auld lang [D]syne, my dear,
for [G]auld lang [C]syne,
we'll [G]take a cup of [D]kindness yet,
for [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
And [G]surely you'll buy [D]your pint cup!
and [Em]surely [G]I'll buy [C]mine!
And [G]we'll take a cup o' [D]kindness yet,
for [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne.
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Chorus}

{start_of_verse}
We [G]two have run [D]about the slopes,
and [Em]picked the [G]daisies [C]fine;
But we've [G]wandered many a [D]weary foot,
since the [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne.
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Chorus}

{start_of_verse}
We [G]two have paddled [D]in the stream,
from [Em]morning [G]sun till [C]dine;
But [G]seas between us [D]broad have roared
since the [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne.
{end_of_verse}

{repeat: Chorus}

{start_of_verse}
And [G]there's a hand my [D]trusty friend!
And [Em]give me a [G]hand o' [C]thine!
And [G]we'll take a right good[D]- will draught,
for [Em]days of [C]auld lang [G]syne.
